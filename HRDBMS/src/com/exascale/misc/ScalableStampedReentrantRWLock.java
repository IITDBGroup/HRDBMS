/**
 * <h1>Scalable Stamped Reentrant Read-Write Lock</h1> A Read-Write Lock that is
 * scalable with the number of threads doing Read.
 * <p>
 * Uses a two-state-machine for the Readers, and averages two synchronized
 * operations. <br>
 * Although this mechanism was independently designed and implemented by the
 * authors, the idea is very similar to the algorithm C-RW-WP described in this
 * paper: <a href=
 * "http://blogs.oracle.com/dave/resource/ppopp13-dice-NUMAAwareRWLocks.pdf">
 * NUMA-Aware Reader-Writer locks</a> <br>
 * Relative to the paper, there are two differences: The threads have no
 * particular order, which means this implementation is <b>not</b> NUMA-aware;
 * Threads attempting a read-lock for the first time are added to a list and
 * removed when the thread terminates, following the mechanism described below.
 * <p>
 * To manage the adding and removal of new Reader threads, we use a
 * ConcurrentLinkedQueue instance named {@code readersStateList} containing all
 * the references to ReadersEntry (Reader's states), which the Writer scans to
 * determine if the Readers have completed or not. After a thread terminates,
 * the {@code finalize()} of the associated {@code ReaderEntry} instance will be
 * called, which will remove the Reader's state reference from the
 * {@code readersStateList}, to avoid memory leaking.
 * <p>
 * Relatively to the ScalableRWLock implemented previously, we use a StampedLock
 * instead of a regular lock so that we can default to the StampedLock's
 * operations of readLock() and writeLock() whenever the Writer contention is
 * high. This kind of technique is partially described in the paper mentioned
 * above.
 * <p>
 * Advantages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implements {@code java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock}
 * <li>When there are very few Writes, the performance scales with the number of
 * Reader threads
 * <li>Supports optimistic Reads like the StampedLock (non-reentrant)
 * <li>Fairness proprieties are similar to StampedLock
 * <li>No need to call initialization/cleanup functions per thread
 * <li>No limitation on the number of concurrent threads
 * <li>Reentrant
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Disadvantages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Memory footprint increases with number of threads by sizeof(ReadersEntry)
 * x O(N_threads)
 * <li>Does not support {@code lockInterruptibly()}
 * <li>Does not support {@code newCondition()}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This lock allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock, by acquiring
 * the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the write lock.
 * However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is <b>not<br>
 * possible.
 * <p>
 * For scenarios with few writes, the average case for {@code sharedLock()} is
 * two synchronized calls: an {@code AtomicInteger.set()} on a cache line that
 * is held in exclusive mode by the core where the current thread is running,
 * and an {@code AtomicLong.get()} on a shared cache line.<br>
 * This means that when doing several sequential calls of sharedLock()/unlock()
 * on the same instance, the performance penalty will be small because the
 * accessed variables will most likely be in L1/L2 cache.
